# PI-vision-Project
Final project 
Here, I have created two symbols using amcharts libraries.

By using these symbol we can add multiple tags or attribute so that we can present a visual
comparison between them.

barchart1:- this symbol will present the tags in the form barchart.
radar:- this is a another type of which present a mulitple tags or attribute to perform a comparison.
